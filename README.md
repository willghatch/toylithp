toylithp
========

It'th a toy, that ith only half done.  My idea ith to integrate it well into the JavaThcript world... maybe I'll uthe it in a webpage or thomething.

That thaid, it'th really jutht for fun and learning.

It doeth have bathic primitiveth, thuch ath:

- define
- lambda
- quote, quasiquote, unquote, unquotesplicing
- if
- set
- begin
- defmacro
- procedure calls and macro expansion
- constant numbers, strings, symbols

Ath well ath thome predefined functhionth and valueth:

- plus, minus, div, mult, not
- t, f, n (true, false, null)


I plan to thupport both JavaThcript arrayth and linked lithttth, with [] and () thyntaxth, rethpectively.  And objectth with {} thyntaxth.

But it'th a work in progreth.
