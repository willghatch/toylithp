What does a simple lithp need?

lambda - allow for args list grabbing
(cons/car/cdr - make linked lists possible
other simple functions... +-*/, booleans, equality/inequality (and/or should be short-circuiting derived macros... or I could just use js && and ||...)
(defmacro

tail recursion

error handling of some sort

I think I want n for null (since it's js I'll use null instead of nil), l for lambda...
t for true, f for false, but have the long forms permissible too.
Maybe some syntax with {} and []... they can be objects and arrays, like in JS.
Lists can be {car: foo, cdr:bar} internally.  Maybe allow lists and arrays interchangeably.
For convenience, allow foo.bar notation.

In the end maybe I'll throw in some tests... but it's just a toy...
